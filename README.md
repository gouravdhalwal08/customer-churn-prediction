# Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn based on various customer attributes. The final model is deployed as an interactive web application using **Streamlit**.

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a customer churn prediction model. The project involves:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the data  
- **Data Preprocessing** to prepare the data for modeling  
- **Training an XGBoost Classifier** to predict churn  
- **Deploying the model** with a user-friendly Streamlit web application  

> The final model achieves approximately **94% accuracy** in predicting customer churn.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas** — data manipulation  
- **Scikit-learn** — preprocessing and evaluation  
- **XGBoost** — classification model  
- **Streamlit** — web application interface  
- **Joblib** — model serialization  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** — data visualization
